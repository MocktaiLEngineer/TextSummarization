            "Vikki Howells AM: Thank you I have got one further series of questions around outofcourt disposals which you have already mentioned briefly In your written evidence you say there is ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this Bill Firstly could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option ? \n",
            "Barry Hughes: We have been working with the National Police Chiefs Council Their lead is deputy chief constable Sara Glen She is responsible for developing the police approach to outofcourt disposals and simplifying the range of outofcourt disposals There is quite a range and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved I must say this is primarily a matter for the police because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an outofcourt disposal Any case that the police refer to us for a charging decision is going to be something— There is a document called the directors guidance on charging which is issued by the director of public prosecutions which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an outofcourt disposal There may be cases where it is genuinely very difficult to assess what is the best approach in which case we will have a conversation with them a meaningful conversation about what is the best way to approach that particular case There will also be cases and we see these not that rarely where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage and we take a different view on the public interest stage So we might say—for example it involves a 15yearold youth—we think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute We are not responsible for administering the outofcourt disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal if for example it has conditions attached such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate That is not our responsibility—that will fall to the police—but we can decide that an outofcourt disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution Does that help ? \n",
            "Vikki Howells AM: It does One final question on that then : creating a body of outofcourt disposals that are specific to this Bill—how would that actually work in practice do you think given the fact that the Assemblys legislative competence to make provision on the face of the Bill is limited ? \n",
            "Barry Hughes: The way I might see it is that clearly policings not devolved the CPS is not devolved—the way I might see this is that within Wales you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of outofcourt disposals You can not direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that but if you build a good infrastructure it is more likely that people will be pointed in that direction \n",
            "Vikki Howells AM: And who would build that infrastructure in your opinion ? \n",
            "Barry Hughes: Somewhere within Wales—Welsh Government local authorities the police working in partnership It may be that the police and crime commissioners use some of their commissioning powers to work something up I am not the right person to answer that question \n",
            "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you If I could just ask about awareness raising then : you mentioned the Bill in Scotland but that Bill includes a duty on the Government to raise awareness of the change There is no such duty proposed in this Bill Do you think that is right or should this committee be saying that there should be a similar duty imposed in Wales ? \n",
            "Barry Hughes: I am not sure it is for me to say whether there should be a duty or not I can however say that I think the greater the level of awareness the more likely it is that the Act if passed will achieve its intentions \n",
            "Lynne Neagle AM: thank you And in your written evidence you mentioned the fact that there is no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who is come from outside the UK for example ? \n",
            "Barry Hughes: It is straightforward : if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here—by this country I would say England or Wales I would treat them as one for these purposes—if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that is not an offence in their country but is an offence here then I am afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence So raising awareness is important and I saw and I was pleased to see that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation which is now going through reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something which is potentially divisive and I think you have probably seen some of that Anything like that is a good story and a good story gets out there which means you are more likely to make people aware of it\n",

There was quite a range and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. Any case that the police refer to them for a charging decision was going to be something—There was a document called the directors guidance on charging which was issued by the director of public prosecutions which set out offences the police may charge and offences, the CPS may charge. Offences that they refer to us for the charging decision would generally be offences where they felt that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There might be cases where it was genuinely very difficult to assess what was the best approach in which case they would have a conversation with them a meaningful conversation about what is the best way to approach that particular case. There would also be cases and\n"
